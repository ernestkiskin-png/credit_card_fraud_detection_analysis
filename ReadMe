##Credit Card Fraud analysis

#Overview

This project is created by analysing Credit Card Fraud dataset from Kaggle (Dhanush Narayanan R, 2022). Tools used for data cleaning and analysis include R, Google BigQuery and Excel.
Unfortunately, the data source for this dataset creation is not disclosed in the dataset page on Kaggle. Nevertheless, this project highlights risk areas for credit card transactions, 
portrays overall fraud rate for 1,000,000 recorded transactions and shows the impact of various situations and variables on transaction fraud rates.

#Key Findings:

- On average, distance from cardholders home address to the point of the transaction is 3x farther for fraudulent transactions
- Additionally, on average, the distance from last point of transaction to the point of currently recorded transaction is approx. 3x further for fraudulent transactions
- Fraudulent transaction risks are 9 times higher for online orders than for in-person purchases
- The repeatedness of retailer does not influence or influences minimally fraud rates
- PIN usage reduces fraud by 97 %
- Fraudlent transactions exceed average spending amount by 6x
