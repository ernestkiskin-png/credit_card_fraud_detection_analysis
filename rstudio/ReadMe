# Credit Card Fraud Detection Analysis (R Programming language)

## Overview
Comprehensive data analysis project showcasing Credit Card Fraud dataset analysis
## Business Problem
Credit card fraud costs financial institutions billions annually while creating friction for legitimate customers. This project analyzes transaction patterns to identify high-risk indicators and recommend targeted fraud prevention measures.

## Dataset

- **Size:** 1,000,000 transactions
- **Features:** 8 variables including authentication methods, geographic data, and purchase patterns
- **Target:** Binary fraud classification (8.7% fraud rate)

## Tools & Technologies

- **R** - Data cleaning, exploratory analysis and visualization

## Key Findings

### High-Impact Fraud Indicators
1. **PIN Authentication** - Reduces fraud by 97% (9.6% → 0.27%)
2. **Online Transactions** - 10x higher fraud rate (12.7% vs 1.3% physical)
3. **Geographic Anomalies** - Fraud occurs 3x farther from home (66km vs 22km)
4. **Unusual Purchase Amounts** - Fraudulent transactions average 6x median price
5. **Chip Technology** - Provides modest protection (10% → 6.4% fraud rate)

## Business Recommendations
1. Mandate PIN verification for transactions >$100 and all online purchases
2. Implement two-factor authentication for card-not-present transactions
3. Deploy geographic monitoring to flag transactions >50km from registered address
4. Auto-review purchases exceeding 3x customer's median transaction amount
5. Utilize multi-layered security combining chip, PIN, and behavioral analytics
